Work plan
---------

General Idea: 
-------------
  Create a navigation app for the dorms. The features will be described in 
features.txt file. 
  We will create (draw) our own map for the dorms. it will have a game-like
design with some nice drawings, pictures and maybe animations (e.g cats, people
walking somewhere...).
  The map will be binded to real GPS coordinates. The smartphone will receive 
GEO position from the satellite and we will convert it to a point on our map 
and show to the user. 
  So the GUI must deal with presenting the map and the user location on the 
user's smartphone. 

Server: for notifications from the dorms environment. 
Web Interface for notifications from BAR and from RACAZIM.
- for administration we will add an email account to which they will send their
messages.
